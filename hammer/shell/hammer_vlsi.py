    Resolve and set OBJ_DIR in os.environ for the user who triggered this DAG run.

    Looks up the triggering user (the Airflow LDAP username), then resolves
    their per-user workspace root from ``hammer_poc.user_workspaces`` and pins
    ``OBJ_DIR`` to ``<workspace_root>/<design>``.

    Resolution order for the triggering user:
        1. ``dag_run.triggering_user_name`` (if exposed by the SDK proxy)
        2. SQL lookup against ``dag_run`` table using ``dag_id`` + ``run_id``
           (the canonical source - works in Airflow 3 where the proxy hides
           the field)
        3. ``$USER`` env var (fallback; only used outside Airflow)

    This is the safety mechanism that prevents one user's "clean" task from
    nuking another user's build directory. Every AIRFlow*() instantiation
    accepts a ``context=...`` kwarg and calls this before reading ``OBJ_DIR``,
    so there is no path in the DAG code that can ever touch someone else's
    workspace.

    Returns the resolved OBJ_DIR string for logging.
