"""
Time-saved tracking for the SledgeHammer PD cache.

This module is SledgeHammer-specific telemetry, kept out of the cache wrapper
(pd_cache.py) and the build-system generator (hammer_build_systems.py) on
purpose. It owns everything about *recording* and *reporting* how much time
the cache saves:

  * per-event recording: every cache decision (HIT / MISS_STORE / SKIP_*)
    becomes one event, written to a per-run JSONL file (feeds the exit_ task's
    one-run summary) and to the durable Postgres ledger
    (hammer_poc.pd_cache_events, via pd_store).
  * the recording switch (HAMMER_PD_CACHE_LEDGER / vlsi.pd_cache.ledger_enabled)
    and the project tag (HAMMER_PD_PROJECT / vlsi.pd_cache.project).
  * the per-run summary the exit_ task prints (read_run_cache_summary).
  * cross-run aggregation and the time-saved report behind
    `studio time-saved` and scripts/report_time_saved.py.

The measuring itself (timing the tool around run_fn) stays in pd_cache.py,
where the tool actually runs; this module only records and reports. See
readme_documents/TIME_SAVED_TRACKER.md for usage and attribution semantics.
