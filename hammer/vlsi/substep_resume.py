"""
Automatic sub-step resume for partial tool runs.

Genus and innovus write a checkpoint database at every step boundary
(``write_db pre_<step>``) as the generated script executes. Upstream hammer
can resume from one, but only when the user diagnoses which step failed and
passes ``--from_step`` by hand. This module automates that: when a stage is
about to run and the previous attempt died partway (or was stopped with
``--to_step``), pick the newest checkpoint the tool CONFIRMED writing, check
the inputs haven't changed since that attempt, and resume from there instead
of starting over.

Trust rules, in order:

  * A checkpoint counts only if the tool's log confirms the write finished
    (genus prints "Finished exporting design database to file 'pre_X'"), the
    file is still on disk, and it has not been modified since that log was
    last written. Newest confirmed wins, not newest mtime, so a write the
    tool died inside of is never trusted.
  * The marker file's stage key (the same config+RTL fingerprint the PD cache
    uses) must match the current inputs. A mismatch means the checkpoints
    describe a different design state: they are deleted and the run starts
    from scratch. When the key cannot be computed or the marker file cannot
    be opened, nothing is resumed and nothing is deleted.
  * A resume that makes no progress burns its checkpoint: the next attempt
    uses the next older confirmed one, and when the ladder is exhausted the
    run starts from scratch. No resume loops on a corrupt database.

Explicit flow control (``--from_step`` and friends) and ``--force`` always
win over auto-resume. Gate with ``vlsi.substep_resume.enabled`` or
``HAMMER_SUBSTEP_RESUME=0`` (default on).
