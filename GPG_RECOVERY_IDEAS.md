# GPG recovery ideas

What happens if the Airflow secrets passphrase is lost, and the options for
adding a real recovery path. None of this is wired up right now — the setup is
passphrase-only (see [SECRETS.md](SECRETS.md)). This is the menu for if and when
we want more.

## What's actually at stake

If the passphrase is lost, most of the secrets are disposable:

- `sql_alchemy_conn` — just reset the Postgres role's password.
- `secret_key`, `jwt_secret`, `internal_api_secret_key` — regenerate them; you
  only invalidate existing sessions and tokens.
- `fernet_key` — this is the one that matters. It decrypts the connection
  passwords and Variables stored in the Airflow database, so losing it means
  re-entering those. A fresh standalone setup usually has none, so even this is
  often painless.

So forgetting the passphrase is rarely a catastrophe; it's mostly regeneration.

## Today: regenerate

There's no mechanism — you rebuild each secret:

    # DB password
    psql ... -c "ALTER ROLE <you> WITH PASSWORD '<new>';"
    # fernet_key
    python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
    # secret_key / jwt_secret / internal_api_secret_key
    python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"

Then re-run `sledge-secrets-init.py` with the new values and re-enter any stored
Airflow connections.

## A recovery key

Encrypt the secrets file to a passphrase *and* a second GPG key, so either one
can open it. The recovery key's private half stays offline, away from the
machine — that's the emergency way back in, with no plaintext copy anywhere.

Where to keep that private key, best to worst:

- A hardware token (YubiKey or OpenPGP smartcard). The key can't be copied off
  the device, and using it needs the device plus a PIN, which makes it real
  two-factor.
- A password manager with 2FA.
- An encrypted USB stick or a printed paper key — offline, but single-factor.

A TOTP app (Google Authenticator and the like) doesn't fit: a rotating code
isn't a key, it only gates a service. You'd only get TOTP-gated recovery if the
key lived behind a service that enforced it.

## Other options

- Team escrow: also encrypt to a teammate's GPG key, so any of them can help you
  back in. Good for a shared instance where you don't want to be the only person
  who can recover it.
- Print just the `fernet_key` and seal it somewhere. It's the only secret that
  loses data, so this covers the irreversible case with almost no effort.
- Rotate the passphrase periodically, so a leak only matters for a bounded window.

## Adding a recovery key later

`airflow.cfg` will be blank by then, so re-encrypt the existing `.gpg` instead of
re-reading the cfg:

    gpg --decrypt ~/.config/sledgehammer/airflow-secrets.env.gpg \
     | gpg --symmetric --encrypt -r <recovery-key> --trust-model always \
           --cipher-algo AES256 -o ~/.config/sledgehammer/airflow-secrets.env.gpg.new
    mv ~/.config/sledgehammer/airflow-secrets.env.gpg{.new,}

The plaintext only ever passes through the pipe.
